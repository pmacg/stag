Installation Instructions
=========================

Dependencies
------------
The STAG library depends on the Eigen and Spectra libraries. You should install
them before you install STAG. The STAG website gives an example of how to install
Eigen and Spectra.

Installation
------------
The STAG library can be installed with CMake.

Let's call the current directory 'source_dir' (where this INSTALL file is).
Before starting, create another directory which we will call 'build_dir'.

Do:

  mkdir build_dir
  cd build_dir
  cmake ..
  make install

The "make install" step may require administrator privileges.

You can adjust the installation destination (the "prefix")
by passing the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=myprefix option to cmake, as is
explained in the message that cmake prints at the end.
