# STAG: Spectral Toolkit of Algorithms for Graphs

[![Build](https://github.com/pmacg/stag/actions/workflows/github-actions-test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/pmacg/stag/actions/workflows/github-actions-test.yml)

STAG is a c++ library providing efficient spectral algorithms for the analysis of massive graphs.

## Project Status
The project is under active development and more information and documentation will be added here in the near future.

## Acknowledgements
The development of this library is funded by the EPSRC Fellowship titled "Efficient Spectral Algorithms for Massive and Dynamic Graphs", awarded to [He Sun](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/index.html).
