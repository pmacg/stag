STAG C++
================================
Welcome to the STAG library documentation.
This is documentation for the C++ library.
If you are looking for the Python library documentation, it can be found
[here](https://staglibrary.io/docs/python/index.html).

If you are new to the STAG library, see [Getting Started](@ref getting-started) for instructions on
getting up and running.
Alternatively, the <a href="files.html">Modules</a> and
<a href="annotated.html">Classes</a>
pages contain the
complete documentation of the library methods.

The STAG library provides

* the stag::Graph class with many **basic graph methods**,
* **clustering algorithms** in the cluster.h module,
* **locality-sensitive hashing** in the lsh.h module, and
* **kernel density estiamtion** algorithms in the kde.h module.
